How to run exampleApplication.py
-----------------------------------
1) Modify the 'server_address' variable in PyComputeClient.py's main() function
   to point to the server's IP address. 
   
   Example: 
   server_address = ('192.30.20.10', 6666) #(address,port)
   
2) Copy PyComputeClient.py to any machine you would like to use as a client
3) Run 'python PyComputeClient.py' on the client machines
4) Run 'python exampleApplication.py' on the server machine

Warning: If your server's firewall is on or you client's python session does 
not have the permission to create sockets, clients will not be able to connect 
to the server.
